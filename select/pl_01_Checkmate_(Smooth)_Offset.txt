Straight out the north
(Straight out the north)
I'm having the sauce
(I'm having the sauce)
The vault in the loft
(The vault)
Pop out in New York
Got Chrome on the crosses,
ain't taking no loss
(Chrome Heart)
They lied, I'm really the boss
Two times, I fill up my opps
Fuck three times,
I hit the exhaust
Put the bitch out on the curve
200 large in the black Goyard
They pay me to chop up the words
I hit your crush and curved her
I put the crushed ice
in the peach Crush with the syrup
These nigga be hoes,
they nervous
Just popped the Perc',
it's working
New bitch ain't just bad,
she perfect
Run up the rack
and turn up my circle
Check, ten million in blues
Check, 5 racks on the shoes
Check, hit the Met with your boo
Fashion Week killer,
end up on the news
Check, I get dressed on the moon
Check, I'm a thot, okay, cool
Check, flew yo' bitch to Tulum
I flood her out in the pool, smooth
Check, ten million in blues
Check, 5 racks on the shoes
Check, hit the Met with your boo
Fashion Week killer,
end up on the news
Check, I get dressed on the moon
Check, I'm a thot, okay, cool
Check, flew yo' bitch to Tulum
I flood her out in the pool, smooth
Nigga hating on me,
I'ma fuck his bitch
Coming with a diss
but he ain't on shit
Cut his lights off
when I hit this switch
What the price cost?
I'm 'bout to hit this lick
What the hype 'bout?
Niggas fall off quick
Off the top rope,
like Raw, like Vince
Talking dog shit
when ya dog got spent
Eliantte, you can see it
through the tint,
I started this shit
Watching my 'Gram,
nigga bought all my fits
Hold up my wrist,
then she fuck on my wrist
Sick of this ho,
it's like yuck with that bitch
Balling like I signed
with Klutch with B. Rich
Kobe, I'm coming in clutch
with these hits
Residence,
I'm going pent' in The Ritz
M on the car,
it ain't making no sense
Pop out,
bad bitch coming through,
she threw top out
Fuck school and your rules,
nigga dropped out
Playing tic-tac-toe,
it's a opp out
And my shooter like a janitor,
the mop out
We been sleepin' on the floor
in the trap house
Now we traveling the globe,
I'm a cash cow
She a muse walking 'round
with her ass out
I ain't trying to talk, nigga,
pull the cash out
Check, ten million in blues
Check, 5 racks on the shoes
Check, hit the Met with your boo
Fashion Week killer,
end up on the news
Check, I get dressed on the moon
Check, I'm a thot, okay, cool
Check, flew yo' bitch to Tulum
I flood her out in the pool, smooth
Check, ten million in blues
Check, 5 racks on the shoes
Check, hit the Met with your boo
Fashion Week killer,
end up on the news
Check, I get dressed on the moon
Check, I'm a thot, okay, cool
Check, flew yo' bitch to Tulum
I flood her out in the pool, smooth
